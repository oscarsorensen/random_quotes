    "When you open the fridge expecting new food to spawn by magic.",
    "When you walk into a room and instantly forget your entire mission.",
    "When you try to be quiet opening a snack but the bag screams like a dying dragon.",
    "When you say goodbye and then realize you're walking in the same direction.",
    "When you pretend you're not out of breath after one flight of stairs.",
    "When you wave at someone who was actually waving at the person behind you.",
    "When your phone autocorrects something so aggressively it becomes emotional abuse.",
    "When you re-check the door lock even though you literally just watched yourself lock it.",
    "When Google Maps says 'turn left' and your brain makes you turn right instead.",
    "When you drop something and attempt a heroic catch but just slap it further away."
